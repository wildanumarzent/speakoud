## Scorm 2004 Compliance

### API Implementation Compliance Requirements (Page 19)

#### To be implemented by the LMS
| REQ ID | Requirement |
| ------ | ----------- |
| REQ_60.2 | The LMS shall implement the **cmi.completion_threshold** data model element as real (10,7). The data model element shall support a range between (0.0 .. 1.0). |
| REQ_60.3 | The LMS shall initialize this data model element using the element value of the SCORM 2004 4th Ed. Content Packaging Extensions Version 2.0 namespace element *&lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt;**. If the element value for the **&lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt;** element does not exist as a child element of the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element (associated with the SCO resource) and the SCORM 2004 4th Ed. use of **adlcp:minProgressMeasure** is not being use (see REQ_60.4), then the element shall remain uninitialized.<br><br>**Note:** In this case uninitialized is defined to indicate that no value should be assigned to **cmi.completion_threshold**. In this case, if a SCO invokes a GetValue() request then the LMS shall return an empty characterstring and set the error code to 403.- Data Model Element Value Not Initialized<br><br>**Note:** This use of **&lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt;** is depreciated with SCORM 2004 4th Ed.. Legacy packages may continue to use the element value to initialize **cmi.completion_threshold**, however these packages should be updated to use the new **adlcp:minProgressMeasure** attribute.<br><br>**Note:** The legacy use of **&lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt;**, via its element value, cannot be used in conjunction with **adlcp:minProgressMeasure** attribute. |
| REQ_60.4 | The LMS shall initialize this data model element using the attribute value of the SCORM 2004 4th Ed. Content Packaging Extensions Version 2.0 namespace attribute **adlcp:minProgressMeasure**, contained within the element **&lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt;**. If the attribute value for the **adlcp:minProgressMeasure** does not exist and **adlcp:completedByMeasure** attribute is true then the default value, 1.0, shall be used to initialize **cmi.completion_threshold**. |
| REQ_74.3 | The LMS is responsible for initializing the **cmi.scaled_passing_score** data model element using the IMS Simple Sequencing namespace element **&lt;imsss:minNormalizedMeasure&gt;** associated with an **&lt;imsss:primaryObjective&gt;** element for the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element that references a SCO resource as defined by the following requirements. |
| REQ_74.3.1 | If the IMS Simple Sequencing namespace attribute **imsss:satisfiedByMeasure** associated with the **&lt;imsss:primaryObjective&gt;** element for the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element that references the SCO is equal to true, then the value provided by the **&lt;imsss:minNormalizedMeasure&gt;** element associated with the **&lt;imsss:primaryObjective&gt;** element for the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element that references the SCO resource shall be used to initialize the **cmi.scaled_passing_score** data model element. |
| REQ_74.3.2 | If the IMS Simple Sequencing namespace attribute **imsss:satisfiedByMeasure** associated with the **&lt;imsss:primaryObjective&gt;** element for the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element that references the SCO is equal to true and no value is provided for the **&lt;imsss:minNormalizedMeasure&gt;** element associated with the **&lt;imsss:primaryObjective&gt;** element for the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element that references the SCO resource, then the LMS shall initialize the **cmi.scaled_passing_score** to 1.0. |
| REQ_74.3.3 | If the IMS Simple Sequencing namespace attribute **imsss:satisfiedByMeasure** associated with the **&lt;imsss:primaryObjective&gt;** element for the **&lt;imscp:item&gt;** element that references the SCO is equal to false, then the LMS shall not make any assumptions of a scaled passing score (i.e., **cmi.scaled_passing_score** data model element). |

#### TODO

| REQ_22 | The LMS shall launch the learning resources defined in the content package manifest (imsmanifest.xml) based on the **&lt;resource&gt;** referenced by a leaf **&lt;item&gt;** found in the content organization (**&lt;organization&gt;**). |

| REQ_7.14 | If the communication session has been initialized and the **SetValue()** API method is invoked where a SCO attempted to set a new value (i.e., not replace an existing value) in an array where the index number used (n) is not the next available position in the array, then the LMS shall set the error code to General Set Failure (351) and return false.<br><br>**ADL Note:** Refer to the SCORM Run-Time Environment for more specific situations for this error condition. |
| REQ_7.15 | If the communication session has been initialized and the **SetValue()** API method is invoked where a SCO attempted to set a data model element and the defined SPM for that data model element is exceeded, then the LMS shall set at least the defined SPM for that data model element, set the error code to No Error (0) and return true.<br><br>**ADL Note:** Refer to the SCORM Run-Time Environment for more details on the SPMs defined for the data model elements. |
